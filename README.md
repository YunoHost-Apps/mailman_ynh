Mailman for Yunohost
====================

Mailman is a free software for managing electronic mail discussion and e-newsletter lists. [Official website](http://www.list.org/)

This package intends to provide a straightforward installation and configuration of mailman, nginx and postfix according to typical needs.

I am far from being an expert with postfix or mail in general. Feel free to propose something better if, unlike me, you know what you're doing when dealing with these things :).
