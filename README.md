Mailman for Yunohost
====================

Mailman is a free software for managing electronic mail discussion and e-newsletter lists. [Official website](http://www.list.org/)

This package intends to provide a straightforward installation and configuration of mailman, nginx and postfix according to typical needs.

:warning: This package should be improved. Right now, the interface with postfix is very dirty and it might break stuff on the mid/long term :/
